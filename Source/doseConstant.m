function dos = DoseConstant(m, amounts, times, receivers)
%DoseConstant Easily create dosing functions for a series of constant
%   doses
%
%   dos = DoseConstant(m, amounts, times, receivers)
%
%   This returns a dose structure with a dose applied in a given amount at
%   a given time. The amount of the dose will be a dose control parameter.
%   Set UseDoseControls to [] to disable optimization of these dose
%   amounts.
%
%   Inputs
%   m: [ Model ]
%       A KroneckerBio Model for which this dose will be applied. The dose
%       structure is valid for any Model which has the same number of
%       seeds
%   amounts: [ nonegative vector ]
%       The amount of each dose. If a dose is applied to different seeds,
%       this will be a vector.
%   times: [ nonegative vector ]
%       Times at which a dose will be given
%   receivers: [ index vector {1:numel(amount)} ]
%       If some seeds are not to be dosed, use this vector to indicate
%       which seeds are receiving the dose. If it is not provided, this
%       function will assume that the dose is given to the first
%       numel(amount) seeds.
%
%   Outputs
%   dos
%       A valid dose structure
